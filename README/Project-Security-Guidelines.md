# Project Security Guidelines

Welcome to the security guidelines for the BNSF MarkLogic Project. This document outlines best practices and recommendations to ensure the security and integrity of our project's data processing environment, focusing on Apache NiFi, MarkLogic databases, and Docker containers.

## General Security Practices

### 1. **Regular Updates**
   - Regularly update all software components, including Docker, Apache NiFi, MarkLogic, and any dependencies to their latest stable versions to mitigate vulnerabilities.

### 2. **Secure Configuration**
   - Always follow the principle of least privilege. Configure services and databases to operate with the minimum necessary permissions.

### 3. **Access Control**
   - Implement strong access control policies. Only authorized users should have access to the Docker environment, Apache NiFi workflows, and MarkLogic databases.

### 4. **Audit Logs**
   - Enable and monitor audit logs for all components to detect and investigate suspicious activities.

## Docker Security

### 1. **Docker Daemon Security**
   - Secure the Docker daemon by binding it to a Unix socket or setting up TLS authentication.

### 2. **Image Security**
   - Use official images from trusted sources and avoid public images without verifying their authenticity and integrity.
   - Regularly scan Docker images for vulnerabilities using tools like Clair or Trivy.

### 3. **Container Isolation**
   - Run containers with the least required capabilities using the `--cap-drop` flag and avoid running containers as root whenever possible.

### 4. **Network Security**
   - Utilize Docker's network segmentation capabilities to isolate sensitive components, minimizing the risk of lateral movement during a breach.

## Apache NiFi Security

### 1. **HTTPS Configuration**
   - Configure NiFi to use HTTPS for all communications to encrypt data in transit.

### 2. **User Authentication and Authorization**
   - Set up strong authentication mechanisms, such as LDAP or Kerberos, for user authentication.
   - Define clear policies for user roles and permissions within NiFi to control access to data flows and processors.

### 3. **Sensitive Property Encryption**
   - Use NiFi's built-in functionality to encrypt sensitive properties and credentials stored in the flow configuration files.

## MarkLogic Security

### 1. **Database Encryption**
   - Enable encryption for data at rest to protect sensitive information stored in MarkLogic databases.

### 2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Define and implement strict role-based access controls (RBAC) for database users to limit access to sensitive data.

### 3. **Secure Communication**
   - Ensure that all communications with MarkLogic databases are encrypted using SSL/TLS to safeguard data in transit.

## Incident Response Plan

- Develop and maintain an incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to security breaches, including containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.

## Conclusion

Adhering to these security guidelines will significantly enhance the security posture of the BNSF MarkLogic Project. It is crucial to review these practices regularly and adjust them in response to evolving security threats and project requirements.
