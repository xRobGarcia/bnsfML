# BNSF Bookmarks Import Guide

This guide outlines the steps to import the BNSF project-related bookmarks into Google Chrome. These bookmarks provide quick access to essential resources, including local development tools, project documentation, and web interfaces for Apache NiFi and MarkLogic services.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Google Chrome installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from the [official website](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## Importing Bookmarks

### Step 1: Locate the Bookmarks File

Find the `BNSF_bookmarks.html` file in the project directory. This file contains all the necessary bookmarks related to the BNSF MarkLogic Project.

### Step 2: Open Google Chrome

Launch Google Chrome and open the Bookmark Manager. You can do this by clicking on the three vertical dots in the top-right corner of the browser, selecting `Bookmarks`, and then `Bookmark manager`. Alternatively, you can press `Ctrl+Shift+O` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+O` (Mac) to open the Bookmark Manager directly.

### Step 3: Access the Import Option

In the Bookmark Manager, click on the three vertical dots icon near the top-right corner of the page to reveal a dropdown menu. From this menu, select `Import bookmarks`.

### Step 4: Select the Bookmarks File

A file dialog will appear. Navigate to the location of your `BNSF_bookmarks.html` file, select it, and click `Open` to start the import process.

### Step 5: Verify the Import

Once the import is complete, you'll find a new folder in your bookmarks bar named `Imported` or a specific name if defined in the HTML file. Expand this folder to access the imported BNSF project bookmarks.

## Organizing Imported Bookmarks

Feel free to reorganize these bookmarks for easier access. You can drag them to the bookmarks bar or create new folders within Chrome's Bookmark Manager for better organization.

## Conclusion

You now have quick access to all essential BNSF project resources directly from your browser's bookmarks bar. This setup is designed to streamline your workflow and enhance productivity by keeping important links readily available.
